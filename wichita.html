          <h2>Things you should know</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
          For over seven years Custom Aluminum was pretty much behind the scenes
          in Wichita. Offering our products and services primarily through
          contractors and sub-contractors. Some selling our products and
          services as thier own while we did ALL the fabrication AND
          installation for them. The only way to find us directly was through
          word of mouth.
        </div>
        <div>
          From 2001-07 we were the sole local supplier of mechanical aluminum
          railing in the Wichita area and continue to be, by far, the most
          experienced and professional. When choosing a company, you should want
          to know how long they have actually been fabricating and installing
          aluminum railing, not just how long they have been selling our
          products and services under their name.
        </div>
        <div>
          You will also be interested in the source of their materials and
          whether that company stands behind their products...does their
          supplier provide a warranty? Not just the local company that you know,
          but the one that supplies them, because let's face it, in this
          economic climate your local deck guy might not be around tomorrow to
          stand behind his work. Our supplier is a strong company, still
          growing, even in this economy. They stand behind their products with a
          10 year warranty.
        </div>
        <div>
          If you are considering remodeling your deck or putting up a new one
          and would like to use our railing or a screen enclosure, you may be
          wondering how this will work. Will you have to hire separate
          companies, one for the deck and then us for the railing or screens.
          Not necessarliy. If you have a contractor in mind that you trust to
          build your deck, we will meet with them to ensure our designs will
          work together. An even easier solution is to hire one of our approved
          contractors. They can give you one estimate for the entire job.
        </div>
        <div>
          Approved Contractors: Group Construction - 316-655-6960 We have worked
          with these guys for years. If we were to hire someone to build a deck,
          it would be them. They are honest, no-nonsense, consistent and
          professional.
